# MultiFarm LP Token Vault

Forked from @fubuloubu's reference Vyper ERC4626 implementation

See [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) for more details.

Implements farming for the same token pair, across multiple DEXes.

Supports arbitraging the prices between supported dexes for additional yield (implementation details TBD)
